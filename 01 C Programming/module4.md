### Chapter 1: USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS AND RECURSION

**Types of Functions**

- A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
- there are two types of functions:
  - **Built-in Functions**
  - **User-defined Functions**

Advantages of Functions

1. Managing huge programs and software packages is easier by dividing them into
functions/modules—Maintenance is easier  
2. Error detection is easier—Debugging is easier  
3. Functions once written can be re-used in any other applications – Reusability is
enhanced  
4. We can protect our data from illegal users—Data protection becomes easier  

Modular programming is defined as organizing a large program into small,
independent program segments called modules that are separately named and
individually callable program units.
>It is basically a “divide-and-conquer” approach to problem solving

DEFINITION OF FUNCTIONS
- A function definition, also known as function implementation will include:
  - Function name
  - Function type/ Return type
  - List of parameters/ Arguments
  - Local variable declaration
  - Function statements
  - A return statement

Parameters vs Arguments

- Parameters are the names listed in the function definition.
- Arguments are the real values passed to the function.

**Recurrsion**

- Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly.

Advantages of Recursion

1. Recursive functions make the code look clean and elegant.
2. A complex task can be broken down into simpler sub-problems using recursion.
3. Sequence generation is easier with recursion than using some nested iteration.

Disadvantages of Recursion

1. Sometimes the logic behind recursion is hard to follow through.
2. Recursive calls are expensive (inefficient) as they take up a lot of memory and time.
3. Recursive functions are hard to debug.
